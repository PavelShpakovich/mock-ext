## [2.0.3] - 2026-01-14

### Fixed
- **Query Parameter Matching**: URL matching now ignores query parameters for exact and wildcard matches
  - Exact match: Strips query params from both URL and pattern before comparing
  - Wildcard match: Strips query params unless pattern explicitly includes them
  - Fixes issue where requests with query params (e.g., `?includeCertificates=true`) wouldn't match rules
- **Extension Context Errors**: Eliminated "Extension context invalidated" errors during reload
  - Added context validation in `withContextCheck` before attempting chrome API calls
  - Removed problematic retry logic that caused additional errors
  - Content script now uses `withContextCheck` for all Storage operations

### Added
- **Match Type Descriptions**: Added helpful descriptions for each match type in the rule editor
  - Wildcard: "Use * for any characters. Example: https://api.example.com/users/*"
  - Exact Match: "Match exact URL path (ignores query parameters)"
  - Regex: "Use regular expressions. Example: https://api\\.example\\.com/users/\\d+"
  - Descriptions dynamically update based on selected match type

### Changed
- **CSP Compatibility**: Migrated to declarative MAIN world content script injection
  - Interceptor now injected via `manifest.json` content_scripts with `"world": "MAIN"`
  - Removed dynamic script injection code from content-script.ts
  - Extension now works on all websites including those with strict CSP (GitHub, Google, banking sites)
  - Removed `web_accessible_resources` (no longer needed with declarative injection)

### Technical Details
- Chrome Manifest V3's declarative MAIN world scripts are exempt from CSP restrictions
- Added sync warnings to duplicated code (interceptor.ts and helpers/) to prevent future mismatches
- URL matching logic is duplicated between interceptor.ts (MAIN world) and helpers/urlMatching.ts (extension context)

## [2.0.2] - 2026-01-14

- **Updated Documentation**: Updated PRIVACY.md to accurately reflect only the permissions currently in use

### Changed
- **Permissions**: Reduced from 6 to 4 permissions (`storage`, `activeTab`, `tabs`, `contextMenus`)
- Extension now uses only the minimum required permissions for its functionality

## [2.0.1] - 2026-01-14

### Fixed
- **Duplicate Request Logging**: Removed redundant webRequest.onCompleted listener that caused requests to appear twice in the recording tab
- **Request Log Cleanup**: Request logging now exclusively handled by interceptor for better accuracy

### Changed
- **UUID Generation**: Migrated from custom UUID implementation to industry-standard `uuid` library (v4)
  - Updated ID generation in background.ts, App.tsx, and RuleEditor.tsx
  - Better RFC 4122 compliance and uniqueness guarantees
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed obsolete responseGenerator.ts and unused utility functions
  - Deleted: generateUUID(), isValidURL(), debounce() from utils.ts
  - Removed: responseGenerator.ts and its test file
  - Result: ~150 lines of dead code removed

### Added
- **Test Coverage**: Added 56 new unit tests across 3 new test suites
  - contextHandler.test.ts (7 tests) - Extension context invalidation handling
  - urlMatching.test.ts (36 tests) - URL matching logic (exact, wildcard, regex)
  - i18n.test.ts (20 tests) - Translation validation and language parity
- **Total Test Count**: 78 tests (up from 22)
- **Coverage**: utils.ts (100%), contextHandler.ts (100%), storage.ts (85%)

### Dependencies
- Added: uuid@^11.0.2
- Added: @types/uuid@^10.0.0

## [2.0.0] - 2026-01-13

### 🚀 Major Architecture Change: Client-Side Interception

**BREAKING CHANGE**: Completely redesigned the mocking architecture from Chrome's `declarativeNetRequest` API to client-side JavaScript interception. This is a major version bump due to fundamental changes in how requests are intercepted.

### Added

- **✅ Custom Status Codes**: Now correctly returns any HTTP status code (200, 404, 500, etc.)
  - Previously always returned 200 OK due to declarativeNetRequest limitations
  - Full control over status codes in both fetch() and XMLHttpRequest
- **✅ Response Delays**: Fully functional response delay simulation
  - Accurately simulates network latency for testing loading states
  - Works with both fetch() and XMLHttpRequest
- **✅ Client-Side Interception**: Intercepts requests at JavaScript level before they reach the network
  - `interceptor.ts`: Runs in MAIN world, intercepts fetch() and XMLHttpRequest
  - `content-script.ts`: Runs in ISOLATED world, bridges communication between page and extension
  - Real-time rule updates without page reload
- **🎨 Visual UI Improvements**: Enhanced visual design without text labels
  - Blue accent (border-left) for request matching section
  - Green accent (border-left) for response configuration section
  - Clean, professional appearance with pure visual separation
- **🐛 Comprehensive Debugging**: Added detailed logging for troubleshooting
  - Request matching logs with emoji indicators
  - Rule reception and update confirmations
  - Interception success/failure tracking

### Changed

- **Architecture**: Migrated from `declarativeNetRequest` to client-side interception
  - Removed dependency on Chrome's declarativeNetRequest API
  - Requests are now intercepted in page context before network calls
  - More reliable and powerful mocking capabilities
- **Permissions**: Updated manifest permissions
  - Removed `declarativeNetRequest` and `declarativeNetRequestFeedback`
  - Added content scripts with web_accessible_resources
- **Build System**: Added new webpack entry points
  - `interceptor.js`: MAIN world script
  - `content-script.js`: ISOLATED world bridge

### Fixed

- **NaN Errors**: Fixed multiple NaN parsing issues
  - Validated numeric values (delay, statusCode) before use
  - Proper Blob.size calculation for ProgressEvent
  - Safe defaults for invalid numeric values
- **Timing Issues**: Fixed race conditions in rule delivery
  - Content script now waits for interceptor to load
  - Rules are sent after interceptor initialization completes

### Technical Details

**Why This Change Was Necessary:**

Chrome's `declarativeNetRequest` API with REDIRECT action has fundamental limitations:
- Redirects to data URLs always return 200 OK status
- No mechanism for response delays
- Cannot capture response bodies
- Limited header control

**New Architecture:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│          Extension Background               │
│  - Manages rules in chrome.storage          │
│  - Sends updates to all tabs                │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────────────┘
               │ chrome.tabs.sendMessage
               ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│       Content Script (ISOLATED world)       │
│  - Injects interceptor into page            │
│  - Forwards rule updates via postMessage    │
│  - Logs mocked requests to background       │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────────────┘
               │ window.postMessage
               ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│        Interceptor (MAIN world)             │
│  - Wraps window.fetch()                     │
│  - Wraps window.XMLHttpRequest              │
│  - Matches URLs, returns mock responses     │
│  - Applies delays, status codes, headers    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Migration Note:**
Existing rules will continue to work. No user action required. The extension automatically uses the new interception method.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-01-13

### Fixed

- **HTTP Method Matching**: Rules now correctly filter by HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) instead of matching all methods
- **Regex Pattern Support**: Regex match type now properly uses `regexFilter` instead of `urlFilter` in declarativeNetRequest rules

### Improved
