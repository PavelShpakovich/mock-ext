# Icon Placeholder

Please add your extension icons to this directory:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16px
- `icon48.png` - 48x48px  
- `icon128.png` - 128x128px

## Creating Icons

You can create simple icons using any image editor. Here are some suggestions:

### Quick Option: Use an emoji or symbol
1. Use a screenshot tool to capture an emoji (🔧 or 🎭)
2. Resize to 16px, 48px, and 128px

### Design Tools:
- **Figma** (free, online): https://figma.com
- **Canva** (free): https://canva.com
- **GIMP** (free, desktop): https://gimp.org

### Icon Design Tips:
- Use a simple, recognizable symbol
- High contrast colors work best
- Keep it minimal - icons are small
- Use transparency for non-square shapes

### Color Scheme Suggestion:
- Primary: #667eea (purple-blue)
- Accent: #764ba2 (purple)
- Background: White or transparent

### Example Concepts:
- A wrench or tools icon (🔧)
- A mask icon (🎭) representing "mocking"
- API letters with a slash through them
- Network/connection icon with an X

## Temporary Workaround

Until you create proper icons, you can:
1. Create simple colored squares with text "16", "48", "128"
2. Use any PNG images you have (will be stretched)
3. Download free icons from https://iconscout.com or https://flaticon.com

The extension will still work without icons, but Chrome will show a default placeholder.
